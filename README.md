- 👋 Hi, I’m @Garc964
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT, electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Korean and will always be learning C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginners stuff; I like problem solving, I have knowledge of Linux/C/AWK/SQL/BASH/HTML5/CSS/Python have little actual experience.
Most on Arduino 328P and ESP-IDF scratching the surface of ESP32.
